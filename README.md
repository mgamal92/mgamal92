### Hi there 👋

I'm a Backend Developer with over six years experience working on PHP web applications with different tens of clients and teams from multiple countries. Developing APIs, packages and designing databases. Also I enjoy contributing to open source projects in my spare time.
_Recently_ I'm managing a small team of developers to refactor old PHP code to modern Laravel application.
